# Local Democracy Engagement Platform

> **Hackathon Submission** by *Paritosh Barman* (Student at Masai)

A solo-built full-stack web application designed to **strengthen civic engagement** by making local government accessible, interactive, and impactful for citizens.

---

## Problem Statement

Local civic engagement is declining due to lack of transparency, accessibility, and real-time interaction between the government and citizens. This platform addresses that gap by offering:

- Real-time alerts on local issues
- Easy-to-understand summaries of local policies
- Direct public feedback channels to representatives
- Community-based voting on civic concerns
- Visualization of the policy impact on neighborhoods
- Tools to start and track community initiatives

---

## Solution Overview

This application directly addresses each point in the problem statement through the following modules:

### ✅ Real-time Notifications  
Citizens receive automatic alerts (every 5 seconds for demo) about local issues like water cuts, electricity outages, community events, etc., via WebSockets.

- **Tech Used:** `Socket.IO`, `Node.js`, `React`, `Redux`
- **Example Notifications:** Road repairs, vaccination drives, community meetings, etc.

### ✅ Plain Language Legislation Summaries (Stories Page)  
Civic legislation is broken down into easy-to-read “story cards” to help users understand what's being proposed in their area.

- **UI Elements:** Chakra UI cards, categorized by type (infrastructure, public safety, etc.)

### ✅ Feedback System  
Users can submit suggestions, complaints, or feedback for local representatives, simulating a public communication loop.

- **Planned Extension:** Admin portal for reps to publicly respond and track resolutions.

### ✅ Community Voting  
Voting interface where citizens can express opinions on current proposals or local decisions. Results can be viewed in real-time.

- **Aggregate system:** Votes stored and visualized on a results page.

### ✅ Policy Impact Visualization  
Dedicated section to highlight how passed policies have affected the community — currently shows static data, future updates will support dynamic impact charts.

### ✅ Initiatives  
Citizens can view or start local initiatives like cleanliness drives, awareness events, and street maintenance efforts.
